To train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, you can follow these steps. Below is a complete example using Python with TensorFlow and Keras. üñãÔ∏èüñãÔ∏èüñãÔ∏è The Handwritten Digit Recognizer project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9) sized 28x28 pixels. This project serves as an excellent introduction to image processing and the fundamentals of CNNs.

The process begins with data preprocessing, where the pixel values of the images are normalized to a range of [0, 1] to enhance model convergence. The images are reshaped to include a channel dimension, converting them from 2D arrays to 3D arrays suitable for CNN input.

The CNN architecture typically includes several layers: convolutional layers for feature extraction, activation functions (like ReLU) to introduce non-linearity, and pooling layers (max pooling) to reduce dimensionality while retaining essential features. After flattening the pooled feature maps, fully connected (dense) layers are added, culminating in an output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) using a softmax activation function to produce class probabilities.

The model is compiled with an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a loss function (sparse categorical cross-entropy) appropriate for multi-class classification. Training involves fitting the model to the training data over multiple epochs, with options for validation to monitor performance.

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities. Predictions can be made on new images, allowing for qualitative analysis of the model's performance.

To enhance the model, techniques such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and regularization can be employed. Overall, this project not only demonstrates the practical application of CNNs in image classification but also provides foundational knowledge in deep learning and computer vision.
